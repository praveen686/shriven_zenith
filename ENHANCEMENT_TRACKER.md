## 📝 Notes and Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. **2025-08-31**: Decided to keep reference implementation patterns but fix critical bugs
2. **2025-08-31**: Will implement SPSC queue first, then MPMC
3. **2025-08-31**: Memory pool will use intrusive free-list

### Technical Debt
1. Need to decide on DPDK vs ef_vi for kernel bypass
2. Consider using jemalloc or tcmalloc
3. Evaluate need for custom allocators

### Dependencies to Resolve
1. DPDK installation and setup
2. PTP daemon for time sync
3. Benchmark framework selection
