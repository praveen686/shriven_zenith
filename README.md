# Shriven Zenith - Ultra Low-Latency Trading Platform

## üìä Project Status: State 0 - Foundation Phase

This repository contains the foundational building blocks for an ultra low-latency trading platform. The current implementation provides core components that need significant hardening before production use in high-frequency trading.

## üèóÔ∏è Current State (State 0)

### Components Implemented

#### 1. **Lock-Free Queue** (`common/lf_queue.h`)
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Functional
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Uses `std::atomic<size_t>` for indices
  - Pre-allocated vector storage
  - Basic FIFO operations
- **Critical Issues**:
  - NOT truly lock-free (missing memory barriers)
  - Not SPSC/MPMC safe
  - False sharing due to lack of cache-line alignment
  - No producer/consumer separation

#### 2. **Memory Pool** (`common/mem_pool.h`)
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Redesign
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Pre-allocated object storage
  - Placement new for object construction
  - Simple allocation/deallocation interface
- **Critical Issues**:
  - O(n) linear search in `updateNextFreeIndex()`
  - Not thread-safe
  - No cache-line alignment
  - Uses `std::vector` (potential reallocation)

#### 3. **Async Logger** (`common/logging.h`)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Good Pattern, Minor Issues
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Lock-free queue for log entries
  - Background thread for disk I/O
  - Type-safe logging with unions
- **Issues**:
  - 10ms sleep in flush loop adds latency
  - Union type switching overhead
  - Timestamping in hot path

#### 4. **Thread Utilities** (`common/thread_utils.h`)
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Functional but Inefficient
- **Current Implementation**:
  - CPU core affinity pinning
  - Thread creation helper
- **Issues**:
  - 1 second sleep after thread creation
  - Heap allocation for threads
  - No NUMA awareness

#### 5. **Socket Utilities** (`common/socket_utils.h`)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Good Foundation
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Non-blocking sockets
  - TCP_NODELAY (Nagle disabled)
  - SO_TIMESTAMP support
  - Multicast support
