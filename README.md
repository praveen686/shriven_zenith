# Shriven Zenith - Ultra Low-Latency Trading Platform

## üìä Project Status: State 0 - Foundation Phase

This repository contains the foundational building blocks for an ultra low-latency trading platform. The current implementation provides core components that need significant hardening before production use in high-frequency trading.

## üèóÔ∏è Current State (State 0)

### Components Implemented

#### 1. **Lock-Free Queue** (`common/lf_queue.h`)
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Functional
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Uses `std::atomic<size_t>` for indices
  - Pre-allocated vector storage
  - Basic FIFO operations
- **Critical Issues**:
  - NOT truly lock-free (missing memory barriers)
  - Not SPSC/MPMC safe
  - False sharing due to lack of cache-line alignment
  - No producer/consumer separation

#### 2. **Memory Pool** (`common/mem_pool.h`)
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Redesign
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Pre-allocated object storage
  - Placement new for object construction
  - Simple allocation/deallocation interface
- **Critical Issues**:
  - O(n) linear search in `updateNextFreeIndex()`
  - Not thread-safe
  - No cache-line alignment
  - Uses `std::vector` (potential reallocation)

#### 3. **Async Logger** (`common/logging.h`)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Good Pattern, Minor Issues
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Lock-free queue for log entries
  - Background thread for disk I/O
  - Type-safe logging with unions
- **Issues**:
  - 10ms sleep in flush loop adds latency
  - Union type switching overhead
  - Timestamping in hot path

#### 4. **Thread Utilities** (`common/thread_utils.h`)
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Functional but Inefficient
- **Current Implementation**:
  - CPU core affinity pinning
  - Thread creation helper
- **Issues**:
  - 1 second sleep after thread creation
  - Heap allocation for threads
  - No NUMA awareness

#### 5. **Socket Utilities** (`common/socket_utils.h`)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Good Foundation
- **Current Implementation**:
  - Non-blocking sockets
  - TCP_NODELAY (Nagle disabled)
  - SO_TIMESTAMP support
  - Multicast support

### Performance Metrics (Current)

| Component | Current Latency | Target Latency | Status |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Lock-free Queue | ~100-500ns | < 20ns | ‚ùå |
| Memory Pool | ~1-10Œºs | < 50ns | ‚ùå |
| Logging | ~50ns | < 10ns | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Thread Creation | 1 second | Pre-created | ‚ùå |

- [ ] P&L calculation


## üèóÔ∏è Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.18+
- GCC 11+ with C++20 support
- Linux kernel 5.4+
- Optional: DPDK 21.11 for kernel bypass

### Building
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/praveen686/shriven_zenith.git
cd shriven_zenith

# Build the project
./scripts/build.sh

# Run tests
./cmake-build-release/common/lf_queue_example
./cmake-build-release/common/logging_example
./cmake-build-release/common/mem_pool_example
```

## üìä Progress Monitoring

### Week-by-Week Milestones

#### Week 1 (Current)
- [x] Initial codebase analysis
- [x] Document current state
- [ ] Fix lock-free queue
- [ ] Fix memory pool

#### Week 2
- [ ] Thread pool implementation
- [ ] Logger optimization
- [ ] Initial benchmarks

#### Week 3
- [ ] Time management system
- [ ] Memory optimizations
- [ ] Performance testing

#### Week 4
- [ ] Network stack enhancement
- [ ] Order book structure
- [ ] Integration testing

## üîç Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Lock-free queue concurrent access
- Memory pool stress testing
- Logger throughput benchmarks

### Performance Tests
- Latency measurements (99th percentile)
- Throughput under load
- Memory usage patterns

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end message flow
- Multi-threaded scenarios
- Failure recovery

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- C++20 standard
- `constexpr` for compile-time constants
- `noexcept` for non-throwing functions
- RAII for resource management
- No raw `new`/`delete` except placement new

### Performance Rules
1. **NO heap allocations in hot path**
2. **Cache-line align all shared data**
3. **Use LIKELY/UNLIKELY for branch hints**
4. **Pre-allocate all memory at startup**
5. **Pin threads to CPU cores**
